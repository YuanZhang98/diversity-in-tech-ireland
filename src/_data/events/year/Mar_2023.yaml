Founded by Accenture, Dell and Microsoft in 2011, the network today spans over 20 leading multinational technology companies, who all collaborate to attract, promote and encourage women in STEM careers.</p>
    <p>The Tech Starter series began 3 years ago and is delivered students in third level institutions. The series consists of several monthly events from panel discussions on careers in STEM, to CV and interview workshops. At these events, students can expect to learn about what it's like to work for a technology company and making the transition from third level to the workplace. The aim of Tech Starter is to reduce the numbers of female dropouts from STEM degrees and increase the number of students who enter STEM/technology roles after graduation.</p>
