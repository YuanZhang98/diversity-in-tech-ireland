# Diversity Groups Around Ireland and Northern Ireland
This was initially created way back in 2017 by me (Vicky Twomey-Lee), first via Svtble, then through [Medium](https://code.likeagirl.io/the-diversity-in-tech-community-in-dublin-ireland-vicky-twomey-lee-8b24c50ba188) and more recently [I have it on EventGeek.ie](http://www.eventgeek.ie/news-notes/2019/7/9/the-diversity-in-tech-community-in-dublin-amp-ireland-vicky-twomey-lee) as well. I've stopped updating Svtble but I still update both Medium and EventGeek.ie post. Double the effort, and I'm sure there's been typos made. 

ðŸ¤ž I hope that this time round I can get people to contribute via PRs on Github. Once this is live, I'll stop updating the Medium post (and prob EventGeekie's) with a note to refer to this site instead.

I'll keep the reason why I started this. So here we go!
