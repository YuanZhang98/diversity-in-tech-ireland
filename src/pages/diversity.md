# Diversity Groups Around Ireland and Northern Ireland
This was initially created way back in 2017 by me (Vicky Twomey-Lee), first via Svtble, then through Medium and more recently I have it on EventGeek.ie as well. I've stopped updating Svtble but I still update both Medium and EventGeek.ie post. I hope that this time round I can get people to contribute via PRs on Github.

Templates to be included for each section, and that means others can contribute.
